# Rated-Rentals-App
## Motivation
This project was inspired by the lack of any rental property listing application in my country, Malawi. People often have trouble finding rental properties 
around the country especially under short notice. Being a fresh computer science graduate, I decided to develop this application in order to provide a platform 
for Malawians to be able to look for rental properties with ease and to advertise their rental properties all for free. 

Rated Rentals is a mobile application that provides a platform for Malawians who are looking for rental properties to find their desired homes. 
The property listing includes the property details and the owner’s contact details.
